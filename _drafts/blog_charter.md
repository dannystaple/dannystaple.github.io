# Notes

* Can be used to promote my books/magazines/other blogs.
* Some Ad integration? Amazon links? If appropriate to the content.
* Should be written using markdown. Try to use Draw.io diagrams if necessary (keep it editable).
* Comments/responses - twitter integration perhaps, or just encourage PR's? The latter makes it immediately moderated. Ok - just PR's.
