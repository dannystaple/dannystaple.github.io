# Blog Charter

* Personal ->
  * Gardening/other hobbies outside of computing/robotics.
  * General rants/comment/thoughts/philosophy.
* Technical - electronics articles should go on Orionrobots
* Technical - code (non robotics/ee) should go on Odm Solutions.
* Lego - non robots.
  * What about Lego SciFi robots? I think that still belongs on Orionrobots.
  * Lego spaceships and other stuff belong here.
  * Lego RCX/Technical is clear orionrobots.
  
# Notes
* Can be used to promote my books/magazines/other blogs.
* Some Ad integration? Amazon links? If appropriate to the content.
* Should be written using markdown. Try to use Draw.io diagrmas if necessary (keep it editable).
* Comments/responses - twitter integration perhaps, or just encourage PR's? The latter makes it immediately moderated. Ok - just PR's.
 
# TODO
* Add the "Fork me to comment" link.
