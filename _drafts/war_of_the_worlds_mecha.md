title: War of the Worlds Mecha
---
 <p>
  This weekend, after waiting for our move, I opened the Titan XP
  {{wikilink("Lego", "Lego", "The best known construction toy")}}
  box. Quite an impressive number of pieces, and a good looking mecha for the main model.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, before I even managed the first of the listed models, I got inspired, and created myself a lighthouse and steamer (the movie Titanic was on at the time). Remember - all of the thumbnails are clickable:
 </p>
 <p>
  <a class="internal" href="browseimage288">
   <img alt="Image" class="regImage pluginImg" src="image288&amp;thumb=1"/>
  </a>
  <a class="internal" href="browseimage289">
   <img alt="Image" class="regImage pluginImg" src="image289&amp;thumb=1"/>
  </a>
  <a class="internal" href="browseimage291">
   <img alt="Image" class="regImage pluginImg" src="image291&amp;thumb=1"/>
  </a>
  <a class="internal" href="browseimage292">
   <img alt="Image" class="regImage pluginImg" src="image292&amp;thumb=1"/>
  </a>
  <a class="internal" href="browseimage295">
   <img alt="Image" class="regImage pluginImg" src="image295&amp;thumb=1"/>
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  I then spotted my Geoff Wayne "War Of The Worlds" CD, and was further inspired. This was, after all, a mech set. I had also recently seen a tripod posting on
  {{wikilink("Lugnet", "Lugnet", "Lego Users Group Network")}}
  mecha - so I decided to have a go.
 </p>
 <p>
  I built my own interpretation of the fighting machines as described by HG Wells:
 </p>
 <p>
  <a class="internal" href="browseimage286">
   <img alt="Image" class="regImage pluginImg" src="image286&amp;thumb=1"/>
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  I then modified the boat into something like the ThunderChild - a steamboat/gunship depicted on the musicals cover, fighting a hopeless battle with the martian war machines:
 </p>
 <p>
  <a class="internal" href="browseimage284">
   <img alt="Image" class="regImage pluginImg" src="image284&amp;thumb=1"/>
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  I then took some mobile phone shots of them together - a diorama if you like:
  <br/>
  <a class="internal" href="browseimage285">
   <img alt="Image" class="regImage pluginImg" src="image285&amp;thumb=1"/>
  </a>
  <a class="internal" href="browseimage283">
   <img alt="Image" class="regImage pluginImg" src="image283&amp;thumb=1"/>
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  Then I had an attempt at the fall of the ThunderChild (a major scene in the musical version) - the orange grill is meant to be melting metal.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a class="internal" href="browseimage282">
   <img alt="Image" class="regImage pluginImg" src="image284&amp;thumb=1"/>
  </a>
  <a class="internal" href="browseimage287">
   <img alt="Image" class="regImage pluginImg" src="image284&amp;thumb=1"/>
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  At this point, I decided to go all out, and get out the real digital camera. I put together a polystyrene foam backing - that I hoped would make for a neutral background. I then starting building some scenery for the scene.
 </p>
 <p>
  I built a microscale
  {{wikilink("Lego", "Lego", "The best known construction toy")}}
  London, including Big Ben, Westminster, and Tower Bridge, as well as a
  {{wikilink("Lego", "Lego", "The best known construction toy")}}
  equivalent of cardboard cutout distant burning buildings.
 </p>
 <p>
  Tower Bridge up close
  <br/>
  <a class="internal" href="browseimage290">
   <img alt="Image" class="regImage pluginImg" src="image290&amp;thumb=1"/>
  </a>
  <br/>
  Microscale London
  <br/>
  <a class="internal" href="browseimage297">
   <img alt="Image" class="regImage pluginImg" src="image297&amp;thumb=1"/>
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  Here are some shots of the battle scene
  <br/>
  <a class="internal" href="browseimage293">
   <img alt="Image" class="regImage pluginImg" src="image293&amp;thumb=1"/>
  </a>
  <a class="internal" href="browseimage298">
   <img alt="Image" class="regImage pluginImg" src="image298&amp;thumb=1"/>
  </a>
  <a class="internal" href="browseimage296">
   <img alt="Image" class="regImage pluginImg" src="image296&amp;thumb=1"/>
  </a>
  <a class="internal" href="browseimage303">
   <img alt="Image" class="regImage pluginImg" src="image303&amp;thumb=1"/>
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  Here I tried to get perspective from foot to head of the martian machine:
  <br/>
  <a class="internal" href="browseimage294">
   <img alt="Image" class="regImage pluginImg" src="image294&amp;thumb=1"/>
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  This was a straight on shot - face to face with the war machine
  <br/>
  <a class="internal" href="browseimage300">
   <img alt="Image" class="regImage pluginImg" src="image300&amp;thumb=1"/>
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally - as I was feeling a little proud of my creation, and wanted a bit of fun, I used the Gnu Image Manipulation Tool (the GIMP) to "photoshop" a few of the images:
 </p>
 <p>
  <a class="internal" href="browseimage299">
   <img alt="Image" class="regImage pluginImg" src="image299&amp;thumb=1"/>
  </a>
  <br/>
  <a class="internal" href="browseimage302">
   <img alt="Image" class="regImage pluginImg" src="image302&amp;thumb=1"/>
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  I may try at some point to put together CAD models of these, but unfortunately, many of the parts used in the whole scene are simply not available in LDraw yet.
 </p>
 <hr/>
 <p>
  In other news, I have now received a professional RF signal generator - its not really suitable for square waves and such, but if it works - it could find its uses.
 </p>
 <p>
  This means the home made one still definitely has some life in it, and I probably will continue modifying and improving it.
