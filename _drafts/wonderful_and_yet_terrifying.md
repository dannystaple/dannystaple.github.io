title: Wonderful, and yet terrifying
---
 <p>
  Last night I eventually saw the BBC's Dr Who Episode "Dalek" - where a single live Dalek has been stored in a collection by a rather devious control freak. It was worth it also to see Christopher Ecclestone's Doctor get really mad, and the Dalek telling the Doctor "You would make a good Dalek" - one of the best lines I have ever heard a Dalek say. Oddly enough, Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) actually felt sympathy for a Dalek, but you would have to watch the episode to see why.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following this, I decided to have a look around for Dalek stuff on the net. Anyway I came across some rather interesting Dalek items.

    <br/>
    The first is a great following of people rendering Daleks with various 3D packages - a quick google search, and you will find many. In these, I came across the Spider Dalek - a prototype Dalek which will be some peoples worst nightmares combined!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This led me to the one remaining source of good renders of these - the Dalek Chess Project. Yes - some crazy people have started a project to make a battlechess game variant with Daleks as pieces. It uses the two factions (Rebel and Imperials) seen in Remembrance of the Daleks, and has the Dalek Spiders as Bishops.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    For those of you who have never seen Battlechess, it is rather like the Harry Potter wizards chess - where the pieces brutally smash each other. In this version, they use their deadly death-rays and plungers to destroy each other.

  Finally - because we like
  {{wikilink("Lego", "Lego", "The best known construction toy")}}
  , I also found a
  <a class="wiki" href="tiki-directory_redirect.php?siteId=130" rel="">
   Minifig Scale Dalek
  </a>
  . Although simplistic - it is definitely recognisably a Dalek. Feel free to comment if you have built one of your own - Lego Daleks really would be fantastic.
