The eee pc as a games machine:

Talk about how as a child, an all games machine was the ultimate dream. Asand adult my needs and interests have, for the most part, changed. However, gaing still plays a part in my life.

In my childhood, the retro device with many computer systems and a large slider would have a drive where I could store/retrieve the games without fussing with tapes - which in the 80's was a pipe dream - not going to happen for a long time. I had no idea how it would interface, be controlled etc.

As I got older, the hadhelds appeared, the first of course being the gameboy, and tetris was great - we spent many hours playing it, usually in the stores where you could play head to head. Few of us had them, fewer the link cable.
The Sega game gear and atari lynx eventually appeared, and they were kind of great, althogh the battery life was awkward.The games were pricey, and normally you would only have one or two.
I eventually owned a game boy colour, which I used to play RPG's (yes I played pokemon) and other simple games. This was superceded by the Game Boy Advance, which still played mmany of the same games.
Not long after the GBA, I owned my first PDA, the Palm IIIc.
