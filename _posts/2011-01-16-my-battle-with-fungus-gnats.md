Throughout 2008, I had become more and more interested in building my own indoor garden. I had all sorts of plants growing in it, including Tomatoes and herbs, along with some ornamental carnivorous plants and a rubber tree. However, I then was subject to the indignity of a pest invasion.

Being indoors, there was little in the way of natural predators or population controls, and when the gnats started turning up floating in my tea, I had to do something. This turned into a bit of a war!

I kept a journal on the epic, and had embedded it into a general article about pest control, but decided now that it was enough of a journal to make its own page.
