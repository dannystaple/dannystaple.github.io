My wife and I, as you may know, live in London. While there was the fantastic news yesterday that we won the 2012 Olympics, we have been struck this morning, by the devastating news of bombs in Central London.

First - I want to make sure readers, and those who know me know that I was not affected - in fact, I was taking the day off so I can pack for our move to Northolt.

Second - I want to pay my respects for the dead and injured - and also voice my absolute CONTEMPT for the cowards who carried out the act. You know who you are, and your act only demonstrates that you are morons who know only violence - evolve or get lost idiots!

This is Orion, Danny, Signing off for today. Between this, and the move, I am not likely to be posting until at least monday.
