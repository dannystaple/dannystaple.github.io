Continuing my Dalek themed day (I dont know why, but just felt like a bit of Dalek reading) I found a rather amusing game.
[The Last Dalek](http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/games/lastdalek/)

In the game, you play the lone Dalek, taking on the minions of the Van Stratten installation. This is the place that the Dalek's make their re-entrance into Doctor Who as an item in a collection of military relics.

It is a three-quarter perspective shoot-em-up, with the ability to upgrade the Dalek with various alien tech parts. A bit of strategy is involved, as you can only arm two of the tech bits at a time - and they have different functions like opening doors, elevating and shooting to name a few.

I played it through to level five, its quite a neat little web-game, and reminded me a little of some classic old Amiga games.
