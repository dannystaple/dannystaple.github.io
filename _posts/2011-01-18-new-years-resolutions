- current mood: Optimistic

So in 2011 I made a few changes to my life, including starting this blog just to make the odd note and blurb on things.

These are (in short):
- Learn to drive
- Spend more time with my family
- Finish projects before starting others.
- Reduce the clutter around me
- Loose a little bit of weight

I've already gone into some detail on these in My promises To Myself for 2011 {TODO: Squidoo content here}
