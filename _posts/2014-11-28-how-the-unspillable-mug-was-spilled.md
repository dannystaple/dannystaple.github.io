title: How the unspillable mug was spilled...
---
One of the projects I've backed on KickStarter is the mighty mug - an "unspillable" mug for your drinks that wont topple or fall over.

One of my colleagues rather liked it and got quite enthusiastic. I left a post on the [mighty-mug campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jayme39/mighty-mug-the-mug-that-wont-fall/comments) describing the rather amusing situation:

> The good news is I've received the mug. The hilarious news is in demonstrating it, my colleague stuck it to a monitor over his desk, at which point it eventually fell off, knocking over his non-mighty mug of tea all over his desk and his trousers... Shamefully there are no videos or pictures, but oh how we laughed...
