They have filmed a new War Of The Worlds film based upon the H G Wells classic, it features CG not unlike the artwork on the cover of the Jeff Wayne album, and stars Tom Cruise. This looks good.

Go and watch the <a class="wiki" href="tiki-directory_redirect.php?siteId=105" rel="">Trailer</a>!

Don't forget the HitchHikers Guide To The Galaxy will be showing in a few weeks as well.

This <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/touchstone/hitchhikersguidetothegalaxy/trailer_3/hh_trailer_large.html">trailer</a> is by far the best.
