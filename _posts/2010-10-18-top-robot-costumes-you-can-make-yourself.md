Halloween is often about ghosts, ghouls and zombies, but I think there are plenty of scary or at least cool and fun robots out there. If you need something to wear for Halloween, and you are a robots fanatic (or have a robot fanatic in the family), then here are some great ideas to try.

Transformers, stomping giants, Gort, Starwars robots - so many of them are here - and if you've found some I don't have
Most of them can be built yourself, in your home.

# A Full size Aliens Powerloader costume

![](/galleries/2010-10-18-top-robot-costumes-you-can-make-yourself/Full-Size-Power-Loader-Costume-from-Aliens.jpg)

Powerloader is a robotic forklift used in the film Aliens, and fights in a spectacular battle with the Alien queen.
You can build a Powerloader costume yourself using Foamboard, an amber light and a few other parts found in DIY stores.

The Instructables user AlexTheMovieGeek has created this stunning costume and kindly shown others how to build it. The costume is quite heavy, and some improvements could be made in that probably by making more hollow or honeycomb structures throughout. Suiting up is a job that may require a helper too.

# Build a terminator Mask

![](/galleries/2010-10-18-top-robot-costumes-you-can-make-yourself/DIY-Terminator-Mask.jpg)

Throughout much of the 2 Terminator films, Arnie was seen with half his face blasted off, showing a glowing red eye on a smooth metal skull. The effect was quite chilling, serving as a good reminder that this was a robot, a machine assassin.

You can build a face mask to give yourself the look of the Terminator. 
Materials required include a Red LED and battery (easily found in LED torches), and a whole bunch of modelling/casting gear - so this one is relatively involved and may require a bit more time.

# General Grievous Costume

![](/galleries/2010-10-18-top-robot-costumes-you-can-make-yourself/1034px-Grievous_CN.jpg)

General Grievous was a Cyborg who commanded a whole Droid army. He was once an organic creature, a Kaleesh, but was completely reconstructed in a robotic body. He has much anger, and is also a fierce opponent, skilled with a sabre, and due to his robotic enhancements, able to wield multiple Light Sabre&amp;#039;s in battle.

The build is much simpler than the others, using jumpers and foam core. It is one for both the Star Wars fan, and for those with little time to make something more complicated.
