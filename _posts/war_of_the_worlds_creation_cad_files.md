title: War of The Worlds Creation CAD Files
---
 <p>
  I have now uploaded the CAD files to create my microscale war of the worlds scene: <a href="tiki-download_file.php?fileId=26">WarOfTheWorlds.zip</a>.
 </p>
 <p>
  The zip file contains a set of 3 Multipart dats, and one ldr for the various parts that made up the scenes in my gallery
  <a href="http://orionrobots.co.uk/tiki-browse_gallery.php?galleryId=14">
   War Of The Worlds MOC
  </a>
  that I described a while ago -
  <a href="War of the Worlds Mecha.html">
   War Of The Worlds Mecha
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  I have also added to the gallery a couple of rendered images of the creations, as they came out in the CAD, you can probably see the slight differences in the ship, and some stuff on the London backdrop was left out. But the war machine itself was put in completely without alterations.
