I've had a beard for years. This year I've taken it all off, and will grow back a tache for Movember.
Movember is a charity raising money for mens health. My favourite charities are those
that participate in health research and improving peoples health generally.

Health research and care is important to me, and I am no stranger to facial hair fun. I'm clean shaven for the first time in many years - head, lip and chin. I'll let only the tache grow - and see what I get.

I care about seeing the best care, curative and preventative for cancer and also wear a SU2C (Stand Up To Cancer) bracelet.

So first there is an awful picture of me clean shaven - in the first week of Movember. I'll get other pictures and post them as I go.
