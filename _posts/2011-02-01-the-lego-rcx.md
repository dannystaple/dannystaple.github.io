I've recently been tinkering a lot with the Arduino, and I am yet to write about my tinkerings.
However, while I do so, I still think it worth remembering the RCX - the brick that turned Lego robotic!
A brilliant piece of kit, totally hackable, with a number of OS's, custom sensors etc.
It is to my mind the best robotic toy yet made (perhaps apart from the NXT, it's successor).

I collected a lot of info on it, please enjoy my article The Lego RCX, Inside and Out.

For the record - my current robotic projects:
- The brushbot Mark I - an Arduino based smallish bot designed to brush shelves and window sills without falling off. 
  Once the basics are good, the aim is to miniaturise for Mark II, and see If I can make it solar powered.
- A special currently secret electronic gadget for my wife for our anniversary.
- The EEE Bot - since the Ardunio is now getting cheaper than a USB->I2C dongle used in the current EEE bot, my plan is to pop one of those in.
  This means it can be independent of the laptop, or more easy to control/setup.
  The only problem with the EEE bot is that my netbook has duff batteries that dont seem to hold charge well.
  I also have a tiny bluetooth module. If I can figure out how to attach it (it is really tiny and surface mount), then perhaps the EEE bot can become a phone bot...
