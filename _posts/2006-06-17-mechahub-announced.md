The Lego Mecha building community at [lugnet.build.mecha](http://news.lugnet.com/build/mecha) have now been presented with a brand new site for registering, showcasing and discussing Mecha themed Lego models.

Although the site is new, the creators and contributors have trawled Lugnet to include many of the excellent
Lego creations that have been announced there.

This is great news for anyone interested in this (probably rather niche) theme and may go some way to revitalising a community that was in need.
