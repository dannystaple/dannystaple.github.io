Today, among other things, I visited the London Hackspace.
Part of the day meant doing a show and tell with one of my robots, which frustratingly stopped doing what it should do at precisely the wrong moment.

However, the net result (albeit that the people I was intending to show it to didn't necessarily see the best of it),
is that I've now got to see how amazing the hackspace is - and I will be going back, and I learned a few bits, got some time just to tinker with my robot,
and it came out not only working, but working better than it went in!
The robot in question is based on the MD25 module (the RD-01 kit), an Arduino (previously a USB-I2C bridge), and a netbook.

A great place - inspiration, people, tools, gadgets and even shelves with those little fiddly bits you need at a moments notice like a 4mm nut or some wood offcut of roughly such a size.
There was plenty of other things to get distracted by - LED message board, door announcing done with a rather cool computer voice,
little monorail project on the ceiling, and the natural interest of just taking a look at what other people are tinkering with, or pitching in when there are cries of help.

If you get an opportunity - go take a look.
