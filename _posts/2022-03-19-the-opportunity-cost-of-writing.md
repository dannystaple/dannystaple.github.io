I am now writing my third robotics book. It is intensely rewarding to write these, to see my book reach and help so many people come to robotics, or to programming and electronics through robotics. Plus there is a royalty on sales. I also wrote small article series for the MagPi too.

However, this comes at a cost. So many small blog posts on thoughts I could have made, including rescuing the pile of writing I once made for Squidoo and should probably be published here again. There are so many videos to make, some filmed and not edited/published too.

Writing along with having a family takes up a lot of time, excluding so many other things. I will occasionally write on a whim, and I'm keeping a journal with notes. I have a lot of other stuff to write about beyond robotics, and within robotics beyond the scope of the books. Sometimes the hardest thing about writing (or perhaps any large project) is saying no, or at least "not now" to all the other interesting opportunities that present themselves.
