I've recently started reading books written by Robert Heinlein. I realise I am relatively late to this party.
A colleague lent me the book "Job" (thanks Jamal!) to read, and I've read on from there.

Job is the tale of a hapless chap who finds himself being randomly shifted between different versions of his world
- where history and timelines have changed, and the results are different political and technological landscapes.
- The fellow finds himself accompanied by a girl to whom he becomes totally devoted, but this fate is the result of a game played by the Gods,
- a big fat bet (with one God cheating horribly), a little like the biblical job. It is amusing, quirky and brilliantly paced.

The individual finds himself later visiting the Utopian city of heaven, which is actually quite a beaurocratic dystopia, and angels being rude, insensitive and bossy keepers.
He visits other places of the gods too, finding that all is not what he had been led to believe, and with hilarious consequences.

After reading Job, I read Stranger In A Strange Land on my Amazon Kindle.
