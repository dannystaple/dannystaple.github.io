For some fun, I built a mech with scorpion like bug appearance using Bionacle parts. It looks pretty menacing, but perhaps a bit awkward. I didn't get a front face shot which perhaps would have better conveyed the menacing aspect.

It has blue bionacle masks as large bulbous insect like eyes, and menacing mouthparts at the front. The rear tail section could be angled up - rather like a scorpions tail lifting to strike perhaps?
