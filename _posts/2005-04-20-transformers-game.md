I discovered The Transformers game for the Playstation 2. 

The game is great fun, in that you get to choose from three of the autobots (Optimus Prime, Hot Rod and Red Alert) and augment them with the collectible minicons - smaller transformers with cool abilities. 

You can transform while playing, and it is a third person shooter with some melee battle as well - though for low power enemies - you can transform and ruin them down like skittles. It can be a little frustrating - and the difficulty level is fairly high. The scenery is nice, and the actual bots look good. 

It is overall a fun and addictive game, which is quite good looking, and will appeal to new audiences and nostalgic players alike.
