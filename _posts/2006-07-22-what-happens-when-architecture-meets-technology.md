The amazing rotor house is what. This house features a large single room, and then a rotating cylinder which houses a bathroom, bedroom and kitchen. The rotation is operated by a remote.

There is a separate toilet, so the obvious issue of needing a wee in the middle of the night and needing to reach for the remote, is sorted.

The point is that it will be space saving, and very suitable for a single professional living in the city. Most definitely an interesting concept.
