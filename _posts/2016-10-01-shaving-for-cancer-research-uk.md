Last night - I shaved my head for cancer research Uk. 

![Me with no hair](https://images.jg-cdn.com/image/36f57cbd-4c24-4f6b-adbf-1627e0f1a949.jpg?template=FundraisingPageHeroImageM)
I have no hair on my head or beard - and I let my family join in shaving it for me last night.

So far I've raised Â£335.00 for Cancer Research Uk - I hope it can change lives and more people can survive cancer because of it.
