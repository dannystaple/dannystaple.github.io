Some time ago I bought a second user Compaq TFT monitor. I had to spend a little time getting a power supply to get it running. These power supplies are notoriously difficult and expensive to get hold of, so I rigged my own.

These compaq flat screen monitors (not CRT technology) are now getting quite long in the tooth, but were great because they came in rack mount versions too. They would only really be found now on eBay - I would not really advise buying a Compaq TFT, but if you already have one, or have been given one, then this page contains advice on getting one working - specifically power supplies which can be hard to find for this model.

The monitor I used was a TFT5000, but this applies to a number of monitors made around 2003.

# Buying or Finding A Replacement Power Supply for a Compaq TFT 5000

Buying a power supply for these monitors turned out to be quite difficult, and will have become more difficult as the monitors have gotten older. As there are many newer, cheaper monitors, then it could be cheaper to buy another monitor, or at a push hack a power supply for it as I did below.

To order the supply, you will need the following compaq part number: 170427-001.
This is known as the "dual voltage power supply", and is a model that will work in the US and UK without an extra adapter.

Other markings on the dead supply that came with mine were the following: 634p - The power supply series, Australia Approval Number N15701, 5T23 E134642 listed, Level 3 LR58948 certified, 972455-00, LTE Product, S20162, S9754565, 91-56705 and Potrans Electrical Corp - the Taiwanese power supply specialist who manufactured the supply for Compaq. These are included to help other people looking for info find this information.

I am not affiliated or receiving any commission from the following suppliers -these details supplied to help a reader only. I am also not able to source any replacement supplies myself.
The original article had a number of suppliers, but most have since either disappeared off the internet or will no longer supply these parts.
